|  1.    |[1]        | Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k` |       |
|  2.    |[1210]        | Given a binary search tree, find the floor and ceiling of a given integer. |       |
|3.    |[1215]|Given a positive integer `N`, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach `1`.      |  |
|4.    |[1217]|Write an algorithm that finds the total number of set bits in all integers between `1` and `N`. ||
|5.    |[1219]|What does the below code snippet print out? How can we fix the anonymous functions to behave as we'd expect?. |  |
|6.    |[1220]|Write a program to merge two binary trees. ||
|7.    |[1221]|Implement the function `fib(n)`, which returns the `nth` number in the Fibonacci sequence, using only `O(1)` space. ||
|8.    |[1228]|Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged. ||

|13.    |[1168]| Write a function that plays the 24 game. |   |
|14.    |[1164]| Write a function that, given n, returns the number of rounds you'd expect to play until one coin remains. |   |
|15.    |[1163]| Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.  |   |
